## 🔒 The Privacy Manifesto

Unlike traditional online formatters and tools, **DEVHELP.DEV** is strictly client-side.
- **Zero Data Transfer:** Your sensitive data (JSON, JWT, Logs) never leaves your browser.
- **In-Memory Processing:** All logic is executed in your machine's RAM.
- **No Persistence:** No databases, no tracking, no cookies.
